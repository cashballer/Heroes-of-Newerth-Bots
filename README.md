How to Submit a Bot on GitHub
=============================

See the [Submission Process](http://forums.heroesofnewerth.com/showthread.php?504798-Submission-Process) thread on the HoN forums for more details on submitting your bot.

Please note, that you still need to make a Submissions forum thread for your submission and that it must link to your GitHub pull request. Your GitHub pull request must also link to the Submission forum thread. This can be done by first creating the forum thread without a link, then creating the pull request that links to the forum thread, copying the pull request link, and editing your forum thread to include it.

You will only need to do this once per project in order to submit. Unless otherwise noted, steps mentioned here are done on your project branch on the GitHub website.

1. Open your repository on GitHub
2. Switch to your project branch
3. Create a Pull Request
    * If you have the newest GitHub UI, this will be a green button next to the branch selector.
    * If you have the old GitHub UI, this will be a white button with the text 'Pull Request' at the top right.
4. Direct the pull request at the honteam Community branch.
    * The branch that the pull request is aimed at is the one on the left.
    * Make sure that the repository is listed as 'honteam/Heroes-of-Newerth-Bots' and the branch is listed as 'Community'.
    * Pull requests not directed at the Community branch WILL BE REJECTED, and you will be asked to make a new pull request aimed at the Community branch.
5. Make sure the source branch is your development branch
    * The source branch is the branch listed on the right
6. Link your Forum submission thread in description of the pull request.
    * You can do this by editing the description of the pull request after making the forum thread
7. A member of the bot team will assign themselves to your submission and make comments ON GitHub.
    * The comments will (likely) NOT be posted on the forums, only on GitHub. Please pay attention to these comments.
    * Feel free to be an active part of the discussion on GitHub for any project that you are a part of. This is your code - our goal is simply to make sure it works and is efficient.
8. You can make changes to your submission by simply committing the fixes to your original project branch.
    * You should NOT be making changes that were not requested after submitting. As with the forum submissions, the review process is for a STATIC submission. Your submission may be rejected if unrequested changes are made after submission.
9. Once the reviewer is satisfied with your submission, the change will be accepted and merged into the Community branch on the official honteam repository.
